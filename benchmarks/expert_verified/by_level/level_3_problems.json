Assuming the rectified output voltage is constant at a voltage VR, please find an equivalent ac-side resistance for the bridge rectifier Req as a function of VR and the ac current magnitude IA. This can be done with a describing function approach, in which one only considers the fundamental ac component of voltage v\u2019R. Demonstrate that this expression for resistance correctly models power transfer from the dc sources to the rectifier, under the assumption that the inductor current is a pure sinusoid.
