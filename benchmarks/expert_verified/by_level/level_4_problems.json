The top switch is turned on until inductor current iL rises to a positive value ip+. The top switch is then turned off (under ZVS conditions) and the resonant capacitors ring with the resonant inductor until the bottom diode conducts, at which point the bottom switch can be turned on (under ZVS conditions). The other half of the cycle is essentially the reverse of the first half. Derive the minimum current ip+ that will enable zero voltage turn-on of the bottom device. Express this minimum current as a function of Cr, Lr, Vdc, and Vcf. You may assume that Vcf does not change during a cycle. Calculate the turn-off loss of the top switch, assuming that at turn off the current in the switch falls linearly to zero in a time tf. As this converter is designed to operate with \u201czero-voltage\u201d switching, you may assume the switch current reaches zero before the switch voltage rises to the bus voltage Vdc.",
