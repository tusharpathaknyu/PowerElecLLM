      "problem_text": "Problem 2.4 There are many factors that influence sizing of the passive components in practical power converters. Among these are: 1. Ripple (e.g., how much voltage and current ripple are permissible in the component, input and output voltages and currents in periodic steady state operation.) 2. Transient performance (e.g., how much peak deviation away from steady state will occur during a transient condition, such as when the load resistance changes.) 3. A desire to limit the size and cost of the passive components (inductors and capacitors). This problem concerns the selection of passive component values for the buck converter of Fig. 2. This converter operates with a switching frequency of fs = 250 kHz from an input voltage of VIN = 48 V at a constant duty ratio of D = 0.5. The load resistance RL can vary over the range 0.5 \u2126 < RL < 1 \u2126. A. A decision has been made to design the system such that the capacitor receives less than 4 A (RMS) of ripple current in periodic steady-state operation. It is also desirable to keep the inductor value reasonably small to save cost and space. Select an appropriate inductor value and calculate the RMS current that the capacitor will receive in periodic steady-state operation. B. A decision has been made that the output ripple voltage must be less than 1.2 Volts peak- to-peak in periodic steady state operation, but that the capacitor should be kept reasonably small to save cost and space. Select an appropriate capacitor value to meet this requirement. Calculate an approximation for the expected peak-to-peak ripple voltage on the capacitor. C. Simulate your design and verify that the requirements in parts (A) and (B) are met. D. A transient specification is now added. The output voltage should remain between 16 and 32 V during a transient when the load steps between 0.5 and 1 \u2126 (either direction). Simulate this transient. Does your design comply with this new requirement? If not, propose a second set of L and C values that meet al",

Various values of AL (nH for one turn) are available in each core (recall that inductance is proportional to the number of turns squared.)

(Of course, the specified windings must fit within the winding area of the core.) a. Calculate the ripple ratio and peak inductor current for operation at full load (150 W). b. Design an inductor that meets the required specification. For simplicity, you may neglect inductor core and winding losses and inductor temperature rise.

The top switch is turned on until inductor current iL rises to a positive value ip+. The top switch is then turned off (under ZVS conditions) and the resonant capacitors ring with the resonant inductor until the bottom diode conducts, at which point the bottom switch can be turned on (under ZVS conditions). The other half of the cycle is essentially the reverse of the first half. Derive the minimum current ip+ that will enable zero voltage turn-on of the bottom device. Express this minimum current as a function of Cr, Lr, Vdc, and Vcf. You may assume that Vcf does not change during a cycle. Calculate the turn-off loss of the top switch, assuming that at turn off the current in the switch falls linearly to zero in a time tf. As this converter is designed to operate with \u201czero-voltage\u201d switching, you may assume the switch current reaches zero before the switch voltage rises to the bus voltage Vdc.",

(Note that the on-state resistance of the MOSFET varies with junction temperature, as illustrated in datasheet Fig. 4.) A. Assume that the device must carry a (forward) rms current of 2.0 A, and that switching losses can be ignored. The MOSFET is attached to a heat sink using an insulating pad with a maximum thermal resistance of 1 \u02daC/W. What is the maximum allowable thermal resistance of the heat sink? B. Suppose the device is instead operated in a pulsed fashion, carrying large pulses of current 1 ms in duration with 99 ms of off time between pulses. If the device is mounted to an extremely good heat sink that maintains the case temperature at 40 \u02daC, what is the maximum allowable current pulse magnitude?
