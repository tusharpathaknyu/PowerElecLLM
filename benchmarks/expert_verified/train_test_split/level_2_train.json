Various values of AL (nH for one turn) are available in each core (recall that inductance is proportional to the number of turns squared.) For 3F3 core material you may assume a maximum allowable flux density of 3000 gauss (0.3 T). You should also assume a maximum allowable current density in the windings of 500 A/cm2. (Of course, the specified windings must fit within the winding area of the core.) a. Calculate the ripple ratio and peak inductor current for operation at full load (150 W). b. Design an inductor that meets the required specification. For simplicity, you may neglect inductor core and winding losses and inductor temperature rise. You should provide key information regarding your design (e.g., core, AL value, number of turns, wire gauge) along with calculations necessary for evaluating your design (e.g., peak core flux density, current density, etc.). c. (Optional \u2013 not graded) Ambitious students may make an approximate calculation of inductor loss. To do so, compute the (approximate) losses in the inductor as the sum of winding and core losses. Winding power loss may be (crudely) approximated as the dc winding resistance times the rms inductor current squared. (In more sophisticated calculations, skin effect may be considered in the windings.) Core power loss in a 3F3 material core can be computed by approximating the ac flux in the core as sinusoidal, and calculating the core loss as: \u221213 \u22123 . . Pcore = 916 . \u00d7 10 \u22c5(10 \u22c5 f sw ) 1 231 \u22c5(05 . \u22c5 Bpk ) 2 793 \u22c5Vcore where Pcore is the core loss in Watts, fsw is the switching frequency in kHz, Bpk is the peak ac flux swing in gauss, and Vcore i",

      "problem_text": "Problem 2.4 There are many factors that influence sizing of the passive components in practical power converters. Among these are: 1. Ripple (e.g., how much voltage and current ripple are permissible in the component, input and output voltages and currents in periodic steady state operation.) 2. Transient performance (e.g., how much peak deviation away from steady state will occur during a transient condition, such as when the load resistance changes.) 3. A desire to limit the size and cost of the passive components (inductors and capacitors). This problem concerns the selection of passive component values for the buck converter of Fig. 2. This converter operates with a switching frequency of fs = 250 kHz from an input voltage of VIN = 48 V at a constant duty ratio of D = 0.5. The load resistance RL can vary over the range 0.5 \u2126 < RL < 1 \u2126. A. A decision has been made to design the system such that the capacitor receives less than 4 A (RMS) of ripple current in periodic steady-state operation. It is also desirable to keep the inductor value reasonably small to save cost and space. Select an appropriate inductor value and calculate the RMS current that the capacitor will receive in periodic steady-state operation. B. A decision has been made that the output ripple voltage must be less than 1.2 Volts peak- to-peak in periodic steady state operation, but that the capacitor should be kept reasonably small to save cost and space. Select an appropriate capacitor value to meet this requirement. Calculate an approximation for the expected peak-to-peak ripple voltage on the capacitor. C. Simulate your design and verify that the requirements in parts (A) and (B) are met. D. A transient specification is now added. The output voltage should remain between 16 and 32 V during a transient when the load steps between 0.5 and 1 \u2126 (either direction). Simulate this transient.

(a) Select L and C such that the input impedance Zin is 50 Ohms resistive at the Industrial, Scientific, and Medical (ISM) band frequency of 27.12 MHz. (b) Find the efficiency of the matching network, assuming that it operates with purely sinusoidal waveforms. For this calculation, please assume that the inductor quality factor QL = 100 at the operating frequency, and that the capacitor quality factor is sufficiently high that capacitor loss is negligible. (Note: Recall that inductor quality factor Q =\u03c9L/R, where R is the equivalent series resistance of the inductor.) Figure 1 A matching network with a resistive load of 75 Ohms.",
