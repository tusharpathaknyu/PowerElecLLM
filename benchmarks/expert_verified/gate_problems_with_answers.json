We tend to think of cancer as a \u2018modern\u2019 illness because its metaphors are so modern. It is a disease of overproduction, of sudden growth, a growth that is unstoppable, tipped into the abyss of no control. Modern cell biology encourages us to imagine the cell as a molecular machine. Cancer is that machine unable to quench its intial command (to grow) and thus transform into an indestructible, self-propelled automaton. [Adapted from The Emperor of All Maladies by Siddhartha Mukherjee] (A) It is a reflection of why cancer seems so modern to most of us. (B) It tells us that modern cell biology uses and promotes metaphors of machinery. (C) Modern cell biology encourages metaphors of machinery, and cancer is often imagined as a machine.
