      "problem_text": "Problem 2.4 There are many factors that influence sizing of the passive components in practical power converters. Among these are: 1. Ripple (e.g., how much voltage and current ripple are permissible in the component, input and output voltages and currents in periodic steady state operation.) 2. Transient performance (e.g., how much peak deviation away from steady state will occur during a transient condition, such as when the load resistance changes.) 3. A desire to limit the size and cost of the passive components (inductors and capacitors). This problem concerns the selection of passive component values for the buck converter of Fig. 2. This converter operates with a switching frequency of fs = 250 kHz from an input voltage of VIN = 48 V at a constant duty ratio of D = 0.5. The load resistance RL can vary over the range 0.5 \u2126 < RL < 1 \u2126. A. A decision has been made to design the system such that the capacitor receives less than 4 A (RMS) of ripple current in periodic steady-state operation. It is also desirable to keep the inductor value reasonably small to save cost and space. Select an appropriate inductor value and calculate the RMS current that the capacitor will receive in periodic steady-state operation. B. A decision has been made that the output ripple voltage must be less than 1.2 Volts peak- to-peak in periodic steady state operation, but that the capacitor should be kept reasonably small to save cost and space. Select an appropriate capacitor value to meet this requirement. Calculate an approximation for the expected peak-to-peak ripple voltage on the capacitor. C. Simulate your design and verify that the requirements in parts (A) and (B) are met. D. A transient specification is now added. The output voltage should remain between 16 and 32 V during a transient when the load steps between 0.5 and 1 \u2126 (either direction). Simulate this transient. Does your design comply with this new requirement? If not, propose a second set of L and C values that meet al",

      "problem_text": "Problem 4.5 Design an inductor for a 150 W, 140 kHz boost converter operating in continuous conduction mode from a nominal input voltage of 14 V into an output voltage of 42 V. The desired inductance is 6 \u00b5H, and it is specified that the inductor be implemented with 3F3 Ferrite material in an RM form factor core. Data for RM10 and RM12 sized cores are included below. Various values of AL (nH for one turn) are available in each core (recall that inductance is proportional to the number of turns squared.) For 3F3 core material you may assume a maximum allowable flux density of 3000 gauss (0.3 T). You should also assume a maximum allowable current density in the windings of 500 A/cm2. (Of course, the specified windings must fit within the winding area of the core.) a. Calculate the ripple ratio and peak inductor current for operation at full load (150 W). b. Design an inductor that meets the required specification. For simplicity, you may neglect inductor core and winding losses and inductor temperature rise. You should provide key information regarding your design (e.g., core, AL value, number of turns, wire gauge) along with calculations necessary for evaluating your design (e.g., peak core flux density, current density, etc.). c. (Optional \u2013 not graded) Ambitious students may make an approximate calculation of inductor loss. To do so, compute the (approximate) losses in the inductor as the sum of winding and core losses. Winding power loss may be (crudely) approximated as the dc winding resistance times the rms inductor current squared. (In more sophisticated calculations, skin effect may be considered in the windings.) Core power loss in a 3F3 material core can be computed by approximating the ac flux in the core as sinusoidal, and calculating the core loss as: \u221213 \u22123 . . Pcore = 916 . \u00d7 10 \u22c5(10 \u22c5 f sw ) 1 231 \u22c5(05 . \u22c5 Bpk ) 2 793 \u22c5Vcore where Pcore is the core loss in Watts, fsw is the switching frequency in kHz, Bpk is the peak ac flux swing in gauss, and Vcore i",

      "problem_text": "Problem 6.3 Figure 3 shows a buck converter with an LC input filter. The 25 W buck converter operates in heavy continuous conduction mode at a switching frequency of 200 kHz, and generates a 5 V output from a 9 V input. The filter capacitor CF is a 220 \u00b5F Sanyo OSCON capacitor; this capacitor has an rms current rating of 3.7 A, and its impedance characteristic is shown in Fig. 3. The filter inductor LF is 220 \u00b5H, and may be considered ideal for purposes of this problem. The input source supplying the buck converter has negligible output impedance. a. Estimate the equivalent series resistance and equivalent series inductance of the filter capacitor CF. b. Select numerical values for the damping components CD, RD such that there is less than 10 dB of peaking in the transfer function from filter input current (buck converter current iX) to filter output current (supply current iY). c. Plot the transfer function magnitude from filter input current to filter output current, including the effect of filter capacitor parasitics. How does this compare to a filter with an \u201cideal\u201d capacitor? d. Calculate the incremental \u201cnegative resistance\u201d provided to the filter by the closed-loop converter operating at full power. Do you expect this to have a significant impact on filter damping?",

Propose a switching pattern for the devices in the flying capacitor inverter that takes advantage of the multilevel capabilities of the inverter and results in an (unfiltered) output voltage vx(t) having no third, fifth, or even harmonics. You may assume that the voltages on the flying capacitors are at one half the input voltage. Note that each switch is switched oppositely with its corresponding \u201cprimed\u201d switch. Consequently, the independent switching functions are qA1, qA2, qB1, and qB2. How many times does each active device switch on and off per ac output cycle? b.

The ac line voltage is rectified to provide a (nominal) voltage V+ = 170 V dc (across capacitor C25), which the dc/dc converter section uses to generate multiple low-voltage dc outputs. a. What type of dc/dc topology is at the core of this converter? b. Would the multiple windings on transformer T1 be wound on a parallel or series magnetic core structure (e.g., KSV Fig. 20.21 or Fig. 20.22)? c. Would it be better to use a gapped or an ungapped core structure in this converter? Why? d. Consider the case where the 3.3 V output is heavily loaded and the other outputs are lightly loaded. Considering the effects of transformer leakage inductance and diode drops, will the 5 V output tend to sit above, at, or below its nominal value of 5 V? (Note: it is the 3.3 V output that is regulated in this converter.)",
