    "problem_text": "Problem 2.4 There are many factors that influence sizing of the passive components in practical power converters. Among these are: 1. Ripple (e.g., how much voltage and current ripple are permissible in the component, input and output voltages and currents in periodic steady state operation.) 2. Transient performance (e.g., how much peak deviation away from steady state will occur during a transient condition, such as when the load resistance changes.) 3. A desire to limit the size and cost of the passive components (inductors and capacitors). This problem concerns the selection of passive component values for the buck converter of Fig. 2. This converter operates with a switching frequency of fs = 250 kHz from an input voltage of VIN = 48 V at a constant duty ratio of D = 0.5. The load resistance RL can vary over the range 0.5 \u2126 < RL < 1 \u2126. A. A decision has been made to design the system such that the capacitor receives less than 4 A (RMS) of ripple current in periodic steady-state operation. It is also desirable to keep the inductor value reasonably small to save cost and space. Select an appropriate inductor value and calculate the RMS current that the capacitor will receive in periodic steady-state operation. B. A decision has been made that the output ripple voltage must be less than 1.2 Volts peak- to-peak in periodic steady state operation, but that the capacitor should be kept reasonably small to save cost and space. Select an appropriate capacitor value to meet this requirement. Calculate an approximation for the expected peak-to-peak ripple voltage on the capacitor. C. Simulate your design and verify that the requirements in parts (A) and (B) are met. D. A transient specification is now added. The output voltage should remain between 16 and 32 V during a transient when the load steps between 0.5 and 1 \u2126 (either direction). Simulate this transient.

Various values of AL (nH for one turn) are available in each core (recall that inductance is proportional to the number of turns squared.) For 3F3 core material you may assume a maximum allowable flux density of 3000 gauss (0.3 T). You should also assume a maximum allowable current density in the windings of 500 A/cm2.

The ac line voltage is rectified to provide a (nominal) voltage V+ = 170 V dc (across capacitor C25), which the dc/dc converter section uses to generate multiple low-voltage dc outputs. a. What type of dc/dc topology is at the core of this converter? b.
