  "content":" PSPICE Simulation Information Download the Microsim (now known as Orcad) DesignLab Release 8 Evaluation version, containing both Schematics and PSpice for PCs. A more up-to-date version can be downloaded from OrCAD.\nSpice tutorial (courtesy of University of Pennsylvania Department of Electrical Engineering). In particular, see How to Get Started with PSpice.\n(Almost) Ideal Diode Model idealdiode.lib (LIB) – If you\u0026rsquo;re creating your circuit with the \u0026ldquo;Schematics\u0026rdquo; tool, incorporate this library into \u0026ldquo;Schematics\u0026rdquo; as follows: Select Analysis -\u0026gt; Library and Include Files. Type the filename idealdiode.lib in the filename box (including the path to the file), and click Add Library. If you\u0026rsquo;re creating your circuit using a standard textfile netlist, add the following lines to your file:\nX1 (node 1) (node 2) diode_ideal .lib idealdiode.lib\nidealdiode.slb (SLB) – If you\u0026rsquo;re creating your circuit with the \u0026ldquo;Schematics\u0026rdquo; tool, incorporate this symbol library into \u0026ldquo;Schematics\u0026rdquo; as follows: Select Options -\u0026gt; Editor Configuration. Select the Library Settings button, and then add the file idealdiode.slb. If you\u0026rsquo;re creating your circuit using a standard textfile netlist, you do NOT need this file.\nHalf-wave rectifier with freewheeling diode and Commutating Inductance (CIR)\nFull-wave rectifier with Commutating Inductance and Current Source Load (CIR)\nFull-wave rectifier with RL Load (CIR)\nAnother SPICE simulator that may be used is LTSPICE/SwitcherCAD III, developed by Linear Technology. PSIM Power Electronics Simulator Try out the PSIM power electronics simulator for free!
